# Liteflow SDK Minimal App

This is the Minimal App example on how to setup your project with Liteflow's [SDK](https://docs.liteflow.com). This implementation uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as well as third-party libraries like [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) for wallet interactions but feel free to implement in any project using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and your preferred web3 provider.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the `.env.example`, rename to `.env.local` and fill in the environment variables according to your setup.

```
# Replace with your API endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT="https://api.acme.com/graphql"
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
