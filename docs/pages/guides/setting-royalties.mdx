# Setting up Royalties for Collections

This guide provides instructions for platform and collection owners on how to set royalties for a collection using the Liteflow dashboard.
## Setting up Royalties
<Callout type="info">
  If you are a platform owner and do not own the collection for which you wish
  to set royalties, you will need to [invite the collection
  owner](/guides/inviting-member#inviting-a-team-member) with the role
  ["Collection Owner"](/guides/inviting-member#team-roles-and-permissions) to
  your platform.
</Callout>
To set royalties for a collection:
<Steps>

### Log In to the Platform

Access the Liteflow dashboard and navigate to the ["Collections" section](https://dashboard.liteflow.com/collections) to view all collections available on your platform.

### Open Royalties Menu

Within the collection detail page, click on the "More" button and select "Set royalties" from the dropdown menu.

### Enter Royalty Details

On the royalties page, specify the addresses that will receive the royalties and assign the corresponding percentage for each address.

_You can add multiple addresses to receive royalties by clicking the "Add"
button. This allows you to distribute royalties to multiple parties, such as
the artist, the collection owner, and other stakeholders._

### Save and Submit

After entering all necessary details, click "Save changes" to confirm the royalty settings. Then, submit the transaction to the blockchain to enforce the royalty settings on-chain.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Any change to the royalty settings will require a new transaction to be
  submitted to the blockchain. This process may incur gas fees, depending on the
  blockchain network used.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Changing royalty settings will not affect previous offers and sales. The new
  settings will only apply to future offers and sales.
</Callout>

Congratulations! You have successfully set royalties for your collection on Liteflow. The royalties will now be automatically distributed to the specified addresses whenever a sale occurs.
