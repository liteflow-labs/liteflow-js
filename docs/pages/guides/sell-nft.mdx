- [Set Up the currency you want to use](./setup-currencies).
- You are owner of the NFT

## Steps

### Access Listings section

Navigate to the [Listings](https://dashboard.liteflow.com/listings) section in your Liteflow dashboard.

Click on the 'Create' button to open the form to create a listing on an NFT.

### Select an NFT

### Optional - switch network

If the NFT is on a different network than your current wallet is, you need to switch to the same network as the NFT. Open your wallet and select the right network. You will need to login again and come back to this page.

### Set the listing details

- **Currency**: Select the currency you want to use.
- **Price per unit**: Enter the price you want to sell the NFT for.
- **Expiration date**: Select when the listing will expire.

### Create the listing

Press the 'Create' button and follow the steps in your wallet.

Once the listing is successfully created, you will be redirected to its detail page.

Anyone can now buy your NFT using your marketplace. If you don't have a marketplace, you can create a payment link (next step).

### Optional - Payment link

You can create a payment link to share on social networks or put on any website to sell your NFT in a few clicks.

On the listing detail page, click the 'Create a payment link' button. Fill the **Redirection URL** and copy the payment link.
After the user successfully purchase the NFT, it will be redirected to the URL indicated in **Redirection URL**.
