If the collection is not listed but is listed in the [Collections](https://dashboard.liteflow.com/collections) section, it means your wallet is not authorized to create an NFT on this collection. Make sure your are login with the right wallet.

- **Supply**: Only for ERC1155. Input the number of edition you want to create.
