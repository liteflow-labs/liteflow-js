## Standard Fee Plugins

Liteflow's standard fee plugins offer ready-to-use solutions for applying transaction fees on your platform, catering to various business models:

- **Percentage Fee**: A dynamic fee structure that calculates fees as a percentage of the transaction value. Ideal for sales where the transaction amounts vary significantly.
- **Split Fee**: This plugin enables the distribution of collected fees between multiple parties, such as creators, developers, and the platform itself, streamlining revenue-sharing agreements.
- **Fixed Fee**: Best suited for platforms with uniform service offerings, this plugin applies a flat fee to all transactions, providing simplicity and predictability for users.

Each of these plugins can be easily activated from the Liteflow dashboard, allowing for quick integration into your platform's financial workflow.

## Creating Custom Fee Plugins

Custom fee structures can offer a competitive edge by aligning with user behaviors and preferences.

1. **Access Plugins**: Go to 'Plugins' from the dashboard.
2. **Initiate Plugin Creation**: Click 'Create plugin' to start.

### Examples of Custom Fees

- **Staking-Based Discounts**: Users with staked tokens receive reduced fees.
- **Activity-Based Discounts**: More active users benefit from lower fees.
- **Time-Based Fees**: "Happy hours" with discounted fees.
- **Loyalty Rewards**: Transactions earn points that reduce future fees.
- **Tiered Fee Structure**: Different fee levels based on user subscription or status.

3. **Set Up Plugin Details**: Provide the endpoint URL and select the relevant event type.

4. **Deploy and Test**: Implement your fee logic and test to ensure functionality.

## Integrating Custom Logic

Incorporate smart contract interactions and external APIs for dynamic fee calculations, enhancing the platform's adaptability to user activity and market conditions.

By creatively configuring fees, you can encourage user engagement and sustain platform growth.
