## Get started

To get started, you first need to fork the repository on [Github](https://github.com/liteflow-labs/marketplace-template).

Then you need to set your [environmental variables](./configuration) in the `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.

Once done, you can install all the dependencies with `npm install` and then run

```
npm run dev
```

Your application is now accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Customization

#### Theme

The theme is based on [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and can be [customized](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme) in the `/styles/theme.ts` file.

#### Application

Your application includes default navigation, metadata, and wallets that can be updated directly from the `pages/_app.tsx` file.
