## Liteflow GraphQL API

Liteflow provides a dedicated GraphQL API for your application.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

More information about GraphQL on https://graphql.org/

### Playground

GraphQL APIs have an easy learning curve and can be easily testable with a playground that lets you explore and test the API.
