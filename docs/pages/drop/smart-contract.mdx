# Smart contract requirements

The Liteflow Infrastructure requires the smart contract to implement at least a mint function and an optional minted function with specific inputs and outputs.

## Mint function

This function will be called by the user. It must mint and transfer the token to the user.

The function must be `payable` and can have two arguments:

| Type                       |                                   Description |
| :------------------------- | --------------------------------------------: |
| [`integer`](#integer-type) |                       Number of token to mint |
| `address`                  | Optional. Address that will receive the token |

The `address` arguments is not required but is strongly advised. If the function doesn't implement it, it will be omitted when generating the user transaction.

Here is examples of compatible function:

```
function mint(address to, uint256 quantity) public payable
function mint(uint256 quantity, address to) public payable
function mintToMsgSender(uint8 numberToMint) public payable
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Liteflow Infrastructure **does not enforce any check on the blockchain** during the execution of the transaction.

It is your responsibility as contract developer to enforce any checks you seem
necessary.

</Callout>

## Minted function

This function must return the number of tokens minted by this drop.

The function must be a `view`, have no `inputs`, and must return a unique output of type [`integer`](#integer-type).

Here is examples of compatible function:

```
function mintCounter() view returns (uint8)
function totalSupply() view returns (uint256)
```

If you plan to do only one public drop, then the function `totalSupply() view returns (uint256)` could be enough.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This function is not required **but strongly advised** in order to display and properly calculate the remaining number of token that can be minted.

If not set, the Liteflow Infrastructure will use the number of tokens created between the start date and the end date of the Drop which may result in inconsistencies.

</Callout>

## Integer type

The `integer` type can be any `int` (`int8`, ..., `int256`) or `uint` (`uint8`, ..., `uint256`).
