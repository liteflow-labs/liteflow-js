# NFT Data

The NFT Data solution serves as a comprehensive toolkit for aggregating, synchronizing, and retrieving NFT data across diverse blockchains. Designed to simplify the complexities of blockchain data, our product facilitates near-instantaneous indexing of NFTs, making data accessible through a robust set of APIs, SDKs, and customizable templates.

Our indexing solutions are designed to interact with a range of blockchains, ensuring comprehensive data collection including ownership details, transfer histories, and market activities. By standardizing this data, we empower you with efficient query capabilities using our [GraphQL API](/tools/graphql-api) or directly within our [SDKs](/tools/sdk-core).
