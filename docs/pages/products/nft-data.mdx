# NFT Data

NFT Data solution serves as a comprehensive toolkit for aggregating, synchronizing, and retrieving NFT data across diverse blockchains. Designed to simplify the complexities of blockchain data, our platform ensures near-instantaneous indexing of NFTs, readily available through our APIs, SDKs, or templates.

Our array of indexers interacts seamlessly with various supported blockchains, capturing detailed NFT data, from ownerships and transfers to trades and beyond. We normalize and meticulously structure this information, enabling swift and efficient querying via our [GraphQL API](/tools/graphql-api) or our [SDKs](/tools/sdk-core).
