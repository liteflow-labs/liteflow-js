# Introduction

The NFT Data Product from Liteflow is your one-stop solution for aggregating, synchronizing, and accessing NFT data across multiple blockchains. Designed to simplify the complexities associated with blockchain data retrieval, our platform provides near real-time indexing of important NFTs, all conveniently accessible via dedicated APIs, SDKs, or templates.

Our different indexers connect to the different blockchain supported to retrieve the NFT data, ownerships, transfers, trades and so much more..., normalize all the information and ensure to structure all these information for easy and fast querying via our [GraphQL API](/tools/graphql-api), or our [SDKs](/tools/sdk-core).
