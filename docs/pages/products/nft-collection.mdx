## How to chose my NFT type

### Type of collection

**Open edition**

Perfect for user generated content (UGC) collections, open edition collections have no limit on the number of NFTs. Users can mint as many NFTs as they want from your collection set their own metadata like name, description, image and even royalties.
This type of collection is not great if you want to control the number of NFTs minted, or if you want to control the metadata of the NFTs.

**Private collection**

Perfect for "e-commerce" you can create your products as NFTs and sell them to your users. You have full control on the metadata and the amount of NFTs minted without being limited on a specific cap.
This type of collection is not suitable if you want to let your users mint their own NFTs.

### Single vs Multiple owners

**ERC721**

ERC721 is the standard for NFTs with a single owner. This is the standard you want to use if you want to create a collection where each NFT is owned by a single user. This is useful if you want to create uniqueness and rarity in your collection.

**ERC1155**

ERC1155 is the standard for NFTs with multiple owners. This is the standard you want to use if you want to create a collection where each NFT can be owned by multiple users. This is useful if you want to create a collection where each NFT is a membership, or a game item.

## How to use it

<Steps>

### Create Collection

Choose the type of collection you want from the [dashboard](/tools/dashboard) and configure it based on your needs: open edition, private, or external limited edition

### Let your users mint open editions

Utilize the minter integrated into the [marketplace template](/templates/marketplace), [API](/tools/graphql-api), or [SDK](/tools/sdk-core) for public minting.

### Mint your own NFTs

For private collections, mint your own NFTs via the minter integrated in the [dashboard](/tools/dashboard).

### Drop System

Want to let your user mint a predifined number of NFTs from your collection? Create a drop from the [dashboard](/tools/dashboard) and let your users mint their NFTs from the [marketplace template](/templates/marketplace).
