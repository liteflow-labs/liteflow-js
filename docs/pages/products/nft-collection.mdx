## Select Your NFT Collection Type

### Collection Types

**Open Edition**:
Ideal for UGC, these collections impose no cap on NFT supply, offering freedom for user minting and metadata customization. Less suitable for controlled NFT issuance and metadata management.

**Private Collection**:
Best for NFT-based e-commerce with full control over metadata and issuance. Not designed for user-minting scenarios.

### Ownership Standards

**ERC721**:
For unique, singularly-owned NFTs, creating distinct value and rarity.

**ERC1155**:
For NFTs with shared ownership, perfect for memberships or game items where multiple copies are beneficial.

## How to Use It

<Steps>

### Collection Creation

From the [dashboard](/tools/dashboard), select and tailor your collection type from open edition to private collection.

### Public Minting

Enable public minting of open editions through the integrated minter in our [marketplace template](/templates/marketplace), [API](/tools/graphql-api), or [SDK](/tools/sdk-core).

### Private Collection Minting

Mint NFTs for your private collection using the minter in the [dashboard](/tools/dashboard).

### Drops Implementation

Set up a drop via the [dashboard](/tools/dashboard) to allow users to mint a predefined number of NFTs through custom rules, available through the [marketplace template](/templates/marketplace).
