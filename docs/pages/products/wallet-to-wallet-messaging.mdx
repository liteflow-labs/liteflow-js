# Introduction

Liteflow's Wallet to Wallet Messaging feature empowers seamless communication between various wallets. Ideal for social interactions, negotiations with sellers, or customer support, this feature uses instant messaging powered by [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/). It can be integrated universallyâ€”either embedded within your existing applications or as a standalone application using our chat template.
