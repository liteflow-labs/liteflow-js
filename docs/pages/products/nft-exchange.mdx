# NFT Exchange

The NFT Exchange solution serves as a dynamic connector for NFT owners and potential buyers. It streamlines the process of creating, listing, and managing NFT offers through the use of smart contracts, APIs, and SDKs. Additionally, it provides businesses with the tools to set custom fees, consolidate offers, track sales from various platforms, and oversee transactions in real time.

Operating on the community-endorsed [Rarible Protocol](https://docs.rarible.org/), our Exchange ensures that all smart contracts are thoroughly [audited](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/rarible-exchange-v2-smart-contracts/), open-source, and managed by the Rarible DAO.
