# Exchange

The Exchange serves as a dynamic platform connecting NFT owners with prospective purchasers. It streamlines the process of creating, listing, and managing NFT offers through the use of smart contracts, APIs, and SDKs. Additionally, it provides businesses with the tools to set custom fees, consolidate offers, track sales from various platforms, and oversee transactions in real time.

The Exchange operates on the renowned [Rarible Protocol](https://docs.rarible.org/), a community-driven solution for NFT creation, management, and trading. Rest assured, all contracts are rigorously [audited](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/rarible-exchange-v2-smart-contracts/), open-sourced, and overseen by the Rarible DAO.
