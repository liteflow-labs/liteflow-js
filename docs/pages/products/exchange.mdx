# Exchange

The Exchange is a robust platform that bridges the gap between NFT owners and potential buyers. Leveraging smart contracts, APIs, and SDKs, the exchange enables users to seamlessly create, list, and manage offers for their NFTs. Businesses can customize fees, aggregate offers and sales activities from other platforms, and monitor activity in real-time.

The Exchange is based on the well established [Rarible Protocol](https://docs.rarible.org/), which is a community-owned protocol for creating, managing, and trading NFTs. Contracts are fully [audited](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/rarible-exchange-v2-smart-contracts/) and open-sourced, and the protocol is governed by the Rarible DAO.
