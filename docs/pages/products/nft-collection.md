# Introduction

Liteflow’s Collection Creation and NFT Minting / Drop feature is designed to provide businesses with a diverse range of options for creating and managing NFT collections. Whether it's a public open edition, a private collection, or external limited edition collections, this feature caters to varying business needs. It even supports lazy minting to optimize gas fees.

## Features

- Public Open Edition: Users can mint NFTs through an integrated minter in the marketplace template, API, or SDK.
- Private Collection: Create and sell products exclusively through a dashboard-based minter.
- External Limited Edition: Import and allow users to mint NFTs via a drop system.
- Lazy Minting: Save on gas fees by employing lazy minting.

## How to use it

- Dashboard Navigation: Head to the Liteflow [dashboard](/tools/dashboard).
- Create Collection: Choose the type of collection you want—public open edition, private, or external limited edition.
- Minting Options: Utilize the minter integrated into the [marketplace template](/templates/marketplace), [API](/tools/graphql-api), or [SDK](/tools/sdk-core) for public minting. For private collections, use the dashboard-based minter.
- Drop System: For external limited editions, enable the drop system for user minting.
